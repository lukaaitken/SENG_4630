# Safety Critical Software Systems Labs

This repository contains my labs for **(Safety Critical Software Systems)**.  
The course introduces the development and certification of safety-critical software, with a focus on **Ada programming** for reliable and safe system design.

## 📂 Labs
- Introduction to safety-critical systems and certification concepts  
- Ada programming basics: syntax, semantics, and program structure  
- Working with types, expressions, procedures, and functions in Ada  
- Modular programming with packages  
- Object-oriented features of Ada  
- Concurrent and distributed programming in Ada

## 👨‍💻 Notes
- All labs are implemented in **Ada**.  
- The labs combine **theory of safety-critical systems** with **practical Ada programming exercises**.
